## Group Members: 
Laura Bathke, Isaac Carr, Lucinda Hodgson, Frewoini Mebrahtu, Mikel Miller, and Janelle Niznik
## Topic:
Analysis of auto thefts in Minneapolis looking at trends in incidence rate
## Rationale: 
* Living in Minneapolis area
* Easily relatable topic
* Cursory investigation of available data shows adequate data sources
* Graphic rich topic
## Questions: 
How do the following impact the number of auto theft incidents in Minneapolis?
* Day of week
* Precinct
* Time of year (month)
* Time of day - dropped due to time constraints
* Weather Conditions - dropped due to time constraints

## Project:
Create an interactive dashboard to illustrate the Auto Theft occurances for 2023.  Showing occrances by 
precinct and neighborhood.   2 vizualizations were developed:
* Bar chart of the precinct statistics
  - Toggle Box
  - Drop down for precincts stats
* Heatmap of incidence
  - Layers for 
    - neighborhoods and 
    - precincts
## Interaction:
* The Bar Graph is contolled by the Precinct Selector:  Sewlect 1 through 5 to see the pricints displayed in the Bar Chart and the precinct information box.
* The Heat Map is controled by zooming in and out using the + and - in the upper left corner.  the neighborhood and precinct layers can be turned on and off using the buttons in the upper right.
## Ethical:
* Does the data reflect the reality? yes the source is the government
* Showing a map of neighborhoods with high car theft rates without other facts could be misleading
* Privacy concerns, map goes to the level of specific homes, but does not share address information; However, the data did show the latitude and longitude of the location.
* Could this be used to drive down real estate prices? Has it been used for that purpose?
